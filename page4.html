			<h4 id = "para1"> The Chicago Bulls have always been a free agent destination with it being a major city and a large with a historic team. With the addition of Nikola Vucevic it could show other big name players that the team is looking to win now and would be willing to pay to have talent come to Chicago. With the 2021 and 2022 free agency having some solid players the Bulls could look to make a run at some of them and build around Lavine and Vucevic. <br><br>

			Additionally, the Chicago Bulls have some very solid and promising young players that they could use in the future, either through trades or developing them into solid role players behind the top guys. Players like Patrick Williams, the teams 2020 first round draft pick, has already made his mark on the team and has brought in some serious praise from great players around the league. However, players like Lauri Markkanen and Coby White could potentially be on the move as they have not quite performed to their expectations and the team may be looking to move them for players that can perform today and will not need to be developed. <br><br>

			However, if the team continues to underperform they can look forward to the 2022 NBA Draft as there some serous players that could turn into greats one day. At the top of the draft class is Chet Holmgren, the 7' high school senior who is already at the top of everyones draft board. While it is unlikely that the Bulls get the number one overall pick there are still some great players that any team would be happy with. </h4>
