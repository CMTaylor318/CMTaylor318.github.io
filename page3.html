			<h4 id = "para1"> During the 2020-21 NBA season the BUlls are currently 20-28 and have 24 games left in the regular season. The Bulls are currently 10th in the Eastern Conference and if they are able to stay in the 10th spot they could potentially get into the play in tournements and bring playoff basketball back to Chicago. <br><br>

			Recently the team decided to move on from some of their younger players in favor of older, more developed players in an attempt to make a run at the playoffs. Notable the trade of Wendell Carter Jr. and a 2021 first round draft pick for Nikola Vucevic of the Orlando Magic. Vucevic was an All-Star in 2019 and 2021 and will bring some valuable leadership and play to the team of young and mostly inexperienced players. </h4>
