			<h4 id = "para1"> The Chicago Bulls have had a long and for the most part incredible history with 6 NBA championships and the some of the absolute best players in NBA history. The team was established on January 16, 1966, and played its first game during the 1966–67 NBA season. <br><br>

			The Bulls saw their most noteworthy accomplishment during the 1990s during which they were known for having one of the NBA's greatest teams in history, winning six NBA titles between 1991 and 1998 with two three-peats. Every one of the six of their title groups were driven by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and coach Phil Jackson. <br><br>
			
			The Bulls won 72 games during the 1995–96 NBA season, setting a NBA record that remained until the Golden State Warriors dominated 73 matches during the 2015–16 NBA season. The Bulls were the first team in NBA history to win 70 matches or more in a single season, and remained as such until the 2015–16 Warriors. <br><br>

			Since 1998, the Bulls have failed to live up to their previous achievements. The establishment struggled all through the 2000s, yet showed promise in the mid 2010s, lead by Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, finishing in a 62-win season in 2010–11. However, because of injuries and departures of key players, the establishment was unable to build on that achievement and has sunk once again into average quality since. <br><br>

			Michael Jordan and Derrick Rose have both won the NBA Most Important Player (MVP) Award while playing for the Bulls, for an total of six MVP awards. The Bulls main rivals are the Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat and the New York Knicks. The Bulls' rivalry with the Pistons was featured intensely during the later part of the 1980s and mid 1990s.  <br><br>

			Fun Fact: The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships while never losing an NBA Finals series in their history. </h4>
